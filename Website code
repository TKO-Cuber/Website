      <p>Bi0H4ZARD is a modified XPWNDFU/ipwndfu bootrom exploit, as documented below.</p>

      <p>The original project by Axi0mX is a jailbreaking tool for the iPhone 3GS (new and old bootrom). I have modified a fork of that tool to make it look nicer and have better function. You can download Bi0H4ZARD below.</p>
